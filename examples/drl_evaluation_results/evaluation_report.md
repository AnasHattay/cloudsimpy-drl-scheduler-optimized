## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive evaluation across multiple scenarios and metrics:

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose algorithms based on specific optimization goals
   - For makespan optimization: Use the best-performing algorithm per scenario
   - For energy efficiency: Consider power-aware variants
   - For balanced performance: Evaluate trade-offs between metrics

2. **Scenario-Specific Insights**: Different algorithms excel in different scenarios
   - Linear DAGs benefit from critical path optimization
   - Parallel DAGs require effective load balancing
   - Resource-constrained scenarios need careful resource allocation

3. **DRL Agent Performance**: 
   - DRL agents show promise but require careful training and tuning
   - Performance varies significantly across different scenario types
   - Consider ensemble approaches combining DRL with heuristics
